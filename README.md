### Credit where its due!
This project is heavily inspired by the awesome work at [coherent-receiver.com](https://coherent-receiver.com).
I plan to make use of some common features, but also plan to do my own customized PCB layouts.
My work will be nowhere near as professional as theirs.
I highly recommend interested readers check out their page.
