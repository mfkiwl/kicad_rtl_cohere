# KiCAD PCBs For RTL-SDR Coherent Receiver Projects
KiCAD projects for RTL-SDR coherency projects

## Board Descriptions
| Board | Description |
| --- | --- |
| clk_dist_4chan | 4 channel clock distribution |
| clk_dist_8chan | 8 channel clock distribution |
| external_clock | External clock interface to RTL-SDR V3 header |
| rf_split | 4 channel rf splitter for calibration noise distribution, two versions |

### Credit where its due!
This project is heavily inspired by the awesome work at [coherent-receiver.com](https://coherent-receiver.com).
I plan to make use of some common features, but also plan to do my own customized PCB layouts.
My work will be nowhere near as professional as theirs.
I highly recommend interested readers check out their page.
